# Telegram Bot Channel Utils

This project is a Telegram bot that, in the future, will be able to generate heatmaps for any financial asset and compose an image with it combined
with the candlestick data for that asset. The updates can be posted on a time basis to telegram channels, configurable by user input, or generated
on-demand by interacting with the bot manually.

## Current features

- Listens for configuration commands from the telegram channels it's in.
- Has logging capabilities for the messages it receives and other updates, configurable via the `logger.py` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- The requirements in `requirements.txt`

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/thewitcher745/heatmap-bot
    cd telegram-bot-channel-utils
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
